This is my Compulsory one source code for both the math part and the OpenGL part. As of 18/02/2024 the code is functional. If it does not work check visual studio version or check for additional package dependencies. 

Math Code:
If you change anything and run the program the generated vertex files must be re copied into the OpenGL source file for the changes to be visible in the render.

OpenGL Code: 
In OpenGL main.cpp, there is an enum that can be set to either AssignmentOne or AssignmentTwo. It’s important to change the appropriate enum value for testing the assignment codes.

Controls: 
W,A,S,D – Movement.
Space – up.
C – down.
Mouse movement – view camera.
